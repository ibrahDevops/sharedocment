To automate interactions with workflow runs in GitHub Actions using the REST API, you'll first need to obtain a Personal Access Token (PAT) or a GitHub App token with the appropriate permissions. Then, you can use this token to make authenticated requests to the GitHub API.

Here's a step-by-step guide to automating interactions with workflow runs:

1. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)
Navigate to your GitHub settings.
Click on "Developer settings" at the bottom left.
Click on "Personal access tokens".
Click "Generate new token".
Provide a note/description for the token.
Choose the appropriate scopes. For managing workflow runs, the repo scope is required.
Click "Generate token".
Copy the generated token and store it securely.
2. Use the GitHub API with a Script
Here's a basic Python script using the requests library to list the workflow runs for a given repository:

python code:
import requests

# Configuration
owner = 'YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME'
repo = 'YOUR_REPO_NAME'
token = 'YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN'

headers = {
    'Authorization': f'token {token}',
    'Accept': 'application/vnd.github.v3+json'
}

response = requests.get(f'https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs', headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    runs = response.json().get('workflow_runs', [])
    for run in runs:
        print(run['id'], run['status'], run['html_url'])
else:
    print('Error:', response.status_code, response.text)
Replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME, YOUR_REPO_NAME, and YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN with your actual values.

3. Automate Further
Depending on what you wish to automate:

To rerun a workflow: Use a POST request to https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}/rerun.
To cancel a workflow: Use a POST request to https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}/cancel.
To get logs for a job: Use a GET request to https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/jobs/{job_id}/logs.
Remember, you can use any language or tool that supports making HTTP requests to interact with the GitHub API.

4. Schedule and Integrate
If you want to regularly check workflow runs or perform some action:

Use task schedulers like cron (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows) to run your script at desired intervals.
Integrate with other systems or tools, like Slack or email, to notify you about the status of workflows or to trigger other actions.
Important Note
Be careful with rate limits. The GitHub API has rate limits, and you don't want to exceed them.
Always keep your tokens secure. Never expose them in your code, especially if your repository is public. Consider using environment variables or secrets management tools.
I hope this gives you a good starting point to automate interactions with your GitHub Actions workflow runs!
